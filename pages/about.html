    Nice to meet you. <br><br><br>

    Currenty a Full Stack Web Developer at a digital marketing agency where we use PHP/MySQL and React across different projects for different clients. I have worked with
    clients like <u><a href="https://www.jonathanlouis.net/">Jonathan-Louis</a></u> and <u><a href="https://createoil.appspected.com">Create Oil</a></u> but my main lead was <u><a href="https://avitamedical.com/us/">Avita</a></u>, a regenerative medical group website built with Craft CMS and MySQL. We mostly used Twig as the templating engine
    but the core of the project used PHP MVC architecture and template queries. I am always collaborating with other developers and project managers when working with clients to meet
    deadlines and milestones, as well as UX/UI satisfaction.

    <br><br><br>
    I also finished an immersive software development program at <u><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a></u> where I was
    taught 3 Full Stack programming languages such as Ruby on Rails, Javscript and Python. I learned everything from Data Structures, RESTful services, and object-oriented programming.
    I've built and collaborated on a few projects but what I plan to pursue after my education is obtaining my AWS developer associates certification. I'm currently experimenting everything from EC2
    instances to putting a VPC together in the cloud. <br><br><br>

    Lastly, I have decided to finally pursue my Bachelors of Science in System Administration at WGU, a program that focuses on automation software, network services, cloud infrastructure, and Linux administration. Expected
    graduation year is June 2021!

    Quickest way to contact me is: <u>johncorderox@gmail.com</u>

    Thanks.
