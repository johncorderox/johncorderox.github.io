    Nice to meet you. <br><br>
    I just finished an immersive software development program at <u><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a></u> where I was
    taught 3 Full Stack programming languages such as Ruby on Rails, Javscript and Python. I learned everything from Data Structures, RESTful services, and object-oriented programming.
    I've built and collaborated on a few projects but what I plan to pursue after my education is obtaining my AWS developer associates certification. I'm currently experimenting everything from EC2
    instances to putting a VPC together in the cloud. <br><br>

    I also spent about a year at a tech start up at <u><a href="http://controlexpert.com/en/start/">Control&euro;xpert</a></u> located in El Segundo, CA. I started when the
    company was only 7 months old and I've done everything from administrative work, training on flagship software like <u><a href="http://controlexpert.com/en/postmaster/">PostMaster</a></u> and coordinating
    with business development on operation team protocols. The HQ team in Germany was working with deploying their first mobile application <u><a href="http://www2.controlexpert.com/en/products/for-insurance-companies/easyclaim/">EasyClaim</a></u>
    where I had the pleasure to do manual and regression testing for their iOS and Andriod platforms. <br><br>

    Coding is my passion, but I do enjoy other things to keep my mind away from it. I love video games (3DS/Switch), fitness, making music (Old casio and yahama synths from the'80s) and learning music theory. Quickest way to contact me is: <u>johncorderox@gmail.com</u>
    <br><br>
    Thanks.
